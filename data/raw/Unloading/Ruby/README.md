Notation: 
0p0 means 0.0, p stands for "."
Pdm = Pressure measurement performed under microscope external to cryostat.
Pdc = Pressure measurement done inside cryostat
bgd = background.
Files for background have "_bgd" at the end.
 20x/40x = 20X or 40X magnification   
 RubyG = Ruby fluorescence measured with green laser.
 RubyR = Ruby fluorescence measured with red laser.        

Folders:
"spectra" folders contain ruby measurement taken simultaneously
