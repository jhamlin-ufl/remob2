Notation: 
0p0 means 0.0, p stands for "."
CS = "Current Sweep". Sets of measurements with "CS" in the file name were performed at different currents but the same pressure.  These are R vs T measurements.

If Current dependence measurement, + "CS" +, otherwise skip this line, Small temperature range measurements performed to see current dependence of resistance measured.
"Type of measurement; warming = increasing Temperature"+

"terminals used for connection, where V for Voltage and I for current" +
"Current Applied"+
"Mode used for taking data, option of taking voltage(Vmode) or Resistance (Rmode)"+
"Attempt number; shows how many attempts were done to take data with same parameters"
